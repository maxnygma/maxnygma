### Hi there 👋

🔥 My last project was [Price Evaluator Bot](https://github.com/t0efL/Price-Evaluator-Bot) for an online hackathon.


👨‍💻 I'm studying C++ for competitive programming and self-development purposes. Also I'm studying statistics and linear algebra for improving my ML/DL skills.  


▶️ I'm currently participating in [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification) Kaggle Competition.  


🚗 I'm interested in self-driving cars, SLAM, stereo vision and 3D-mapping.
