I'm Max. Research scientist at AIRI ([dunno lab](https://dunnolab.ai/)) and a third-year student at National University of Science and Technology MISIS
<br>
My resume can be found [here](https://cutt.ly/y3YvEbv)

🔥 I'm interested in **AI4Science**, particularly in how neural networks can be applied to biological and physical systems to facilitate new breakthroughs in **drug design** and **quantum chemistry**   

👁️ My last project was [Identity Curvature Laplace Approximation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10464.pdf) (WACV 2025)

👨‍💻 Apart from machine learning, I do workout, explore deeptech startups and travel occasionally
