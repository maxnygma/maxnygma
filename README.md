👨‍💻 I'm currently developing an MLaaS platform for convenient model training and deployment. I'm studying statistics and linear algebra for improving my ML/DL skills.  


▶️ I'm currently participating in [Indoor Location & Navigation Challenge by Microsoft Research](https://www.kaggle.com/c/indoor-location-navigation) Kaggle Competition.
