### Hi there 👋

My personal blog - https://xzcodes.github.io/

🔥 My last project was [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/t0efL/Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification).


👨‍💻 I'm currently developing an MLOps platform for convenient model training and deployment. 


▶️ I'm currently participating in [SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection) 
and [SETI Breakthrough Listen - E.T. Signal Search](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen) Kaggle Competitions.  


🚗 I'm interested in self-driving cars, SLAM, stereo vision and 3D-mapping.
