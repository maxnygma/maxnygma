### Hi there 👋

🔥 My last project was [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/t0efL/Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification)


👨‍💻 I'm currently developing MLaaS platform for convenient model training and deployment. I'm studying statistics and linear algebra for improving my ML/DL skills.  


▶️ I'm currently participating in [VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection) Kaggle Competition.  


🚗 I'm interested in self-driving cars, SLAM, stereo vision and 3D-mapping.
