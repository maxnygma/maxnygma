I'm Max. Research scientist at [AIRI](https://airi.net/?force=en) and a third-year student at National University of Science and Technology MISIS
<br>
My resume can be found [here](https://cutt.ly/y3YvEbv)

🔥 I'm interested in AI4Science, particularly in **molecular and material representations** with applications to **clean energy** and **computational pharmacology**

👁️ My last project was [Unveiling Empirical Pathologies of Laplace Approximation for Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10464.pdf) (AAAI 2024 Deployable AI Workshop)

👨‍💻 Apart from machine learning, I do workout, explore deeptech startups and cross-field applied research
