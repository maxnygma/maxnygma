I'm Max. Machine learning research scientist and a second-year student at National University of Science and Technology MISIS. Love to solve complicated tasks
<br>
My personal blog - https://maxnygma.github.io/
<br>
My resume can be found [here](https://cutt.ly/y3YvEbv)

🔥 I'm interested in a wide range of deep learning tasks such as probabilistic methods, OOD-detection and graph theory

👁️ My last project was [Catching Image Retrieval Generalization (preprint)]([https://github.com/maxnygma/NeuralXRD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13357.pdf))

👨‍💻 Apart from machine learning, I do workout, explore deeptech startups and cross-field applied research
