I'm Max. Machine learning research scientist and a second-year student at National University of Science and Technology MISIS
<br>
My resume can be found [here](https://cutt.ly/y3YvEbv)

🔥 I'm interested in probabilistic methods, generative models and graph theory

👁️ My last project was [Diversifying Deep Ensembles: A Saliency Map Approach for Enhanced OOD Detection, Calibration and Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11616.pdf) (preprint)

👨‍💻 Apart from machine learning, I do workout, explore deeptech startups and cross-field applied research
